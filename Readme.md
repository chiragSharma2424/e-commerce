# 🛒 Multi-Ecommerce Projects (MERN + Vanilla JS)

Welcome to the **Multi-Ecommerce Projects** repository!  
This is a practice and portfolio project where I’m building **multiple e-commerce platforms** using both:

- 🔹 MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
- 🔹 Vanilla JavaScript (HTML, CSS, JS – no frameworks)

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Learn and practice building complete e-commerce apps from **scratch**.
- Understand both **modern full-stack development (MERN)** and **fundamental web dev (Vanilla)**.
- Focus on clean structure, authentication, product management, and cart/payment features.
